# Modern Full-stack

Boilerplate structure to help you work end-to-end, with Typescript. It's kinda "full-stack" as in a single project you have the BE code as well as the FE code, and you're concerned with managing the both.


## Core Technologies
- Node.js (BE)
- Vanilla JS(or TS) with Vite(BE) - BYOF

## Base Structure
```
mfs/
  client/
    src/main.ts
    index.html
    package.json
  server/
    src/index.ts
    package.json
```
