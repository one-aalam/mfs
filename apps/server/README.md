One of the common mistakes we do as developers or as code overseers, if we're just conscious on the pace of delivery is we let the code standard and quality take a backseat.

This decreases our productivity and lead to a lot of maintenance woes in long run as it introduces issues like

- Non-standardization of syntax - As folks with varied experience and knowhow level can contribute to the same codebase, it leads to a bit of heteregenous structure, where code for similar functionalites
  - can look different - mix of modern and outdated syntax
  - can perform different - mix of performant/reccommended and non-reccommended approaches
- Inconsistent styling - code coming from different developers may lead to inconsistent styling as everybody have their way of writing

People can refer manuals and style guides, but that's a conscious choice totally up to folks, not a remedy or a guarentee that such issues could be resolved consistently.

So, automation comes to rescue!

We can put a guy, to oversee the quality, but this could even be too much work for few such folks, and not the right use of their time and talent.

Let's automate this too...
